**Figure 1A: Schematic.** A. Utility of data-driven classification of spatiotemporal frequency boundaries in neurodevelopmental disorders in precision medicine applications. 

**Figure 1B: Exemplar.** B. Example of single-subject gedBounds derivation. Heatplot depicts strength of spatiotemporal linear correlation coefficient between narrow frequency filtered and broadband signal channel co-variance matrices (see Methods). Coherent blocks of distinct patterns of neural activity are delineated by a clustering algorithm (magenta line). Each block contains a lower (green arrow) and upper (red arrow) detected boundary. Topographic source projects constructed from PCA-averaged eigenvectors are place adjacent to heatmap clusters. The magnitude of the separation between narrow and broadband matrices is represented by eigenvalues (blue line). 

**Figure 1C: Group comparison.** C. Mean kernel density estimates (KDE) of empirically defined frequency boundaries, separated by group and sex. Higher KDE values represent greater density of detected boundaries per frequency step. Lower and upper bounds were modeled and are visualized separately. A three-way interaction effect between Group X Sex X Frequency was present (Lower: F77, 10087=1.72, p=.005; Upper: F77, 10087=1.3, p=.047). Asterisks indicate statistical difference between control and FXS groups. Black bars provide contextual comparison with canonical frequency bands. Blue bars indicate line noise notch filter.

**Figure 2A: Analysis of empirical alpha component.** A. Subject level paired plot of identified lower and upper alpha band boundaries for FXS and control groups. Each alpha band was identified as the closest, but not exceeding, lower bound to 10 Hz. Asterisks indicate significant within-group difference between lower and upper bound. 

**Figure 2B:** B. Matching templates. EEG templates were created with gaussian map centered on electrode FCz or PCz. Templates were used to determine similarity of neural projection to either anterior or posterior topography.

**Figure 2C:**  C. Posterior topography preference for alpha component in controls. Boxplot depicting similarity of empirical alpha component to either anterior or posterior topography. Scatter plot (with random horizontal offset for clarity) shows subject-level data. Comparing topography within groups revealed a lack of differentiation among participants with FXS, but a posterior topography preference among controls participants.

**Figure 2DE:** D. Anterior topography preference for alpha component in FXS. Density plot of correlations representing subject-level matching of identified alpha component and mid-frontal topology. E. Topography of alpha component is significantly altered in FXS participants (F1,131=4.9, p=.028). Alpha component demonstrates a greater degree of similarity to a mid-frontal distribution.

**Figure 3:** Improved auditory attention was positive correlated with increased relative alpha power in males with FXS. Alpha power was empirically derived with subject level boundaries visualized in Figure 2A. Simple correlation plot presented for visualization only. Adjusted age-corrected results presented in text (rpartial=.57, p<.001, n=32, 5% FDR p < .05). 

**Supplemental Table 1: Pre-processing Results.** Raw EEG data was blindly pre-processed in regards to group assignment. Results of the final datasets showed no significant differences in pre-processing characteristics. Abbreviations: FXS, Fragile X Syndrome.

**Supplemental Table 2: Density of detected frequency bounds.** 5% false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted *p* of significant post-hoc comparisons of detected frequency bound densities. Statistical comparison between groups was performed using a linear mixed effect model. A three-way interaction effect was present (Lower: F<sub>77, 10087</sub>==1.72, p=.005; Upper: F~77, 10087~1.3, *p*=.047). Abbreviations: *, FDR adjusted p < .05.

**Supplemental Table 3: Results and least-squares means (LSmeans) of linear mixed effect model comparing alpha component between groups. A. LME Results:** Each alpha band was identified as the closest, but not exceeding, lower bound to 10 Hz. Model considered group and sex as fixed effect with boundType (lower or upper bound) as a within subject factor. Subject was a random effect. No group or sex effects were identified. **B. Estimates:** Providing additional face validity to the methodology, the mean range of the empirical alpha band for either group is consistent with the canonical definition of EEG alpha band.

**Supplemental Table 5:** Model results and least-square mean estimates of alpha component topography. Within-group contrasts: A significant preference for posterior over anterior topography of the alpha component was identified in control, but not FXS, participants. 

**Supplemental Table 6:** Model results and least-square mean estimates of alpha component topography. Group differences: post-hoc contrasts identified a significant anterior topography preference of the empirical alpha component in the FXS group.

**Supplemental Figure 1: Uniformity of activity within identified boundaries as a function of frequency ** The squared correlation maps indicate the uniformity of spatiotemporal coherent activity within an identified frequency. We plotted the correlation coefficient as the function of the central frequency of each identified boundary (see Figure X). No correlation was identified in male cohorts or females with FXS. A weak inverse correlation was found in control female such that higher frequency bands had reduced correlation than lower frequency bands (r=-.15, p <.01).
