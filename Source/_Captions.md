**Figure 1.** Spectral alterations suggestive of neocortical hyperexcitability in FXS. Scalp and source-localization of dense array electroencephalography (EEG) suggest broadband power disruptions in frequency oscillations in FXS (n=70) compared to age- and sex-matched controls (n=71). A. Subject-level scatter plot of intellectual disability as estimated by non-verbal intelligence z-scores (NVIQ) by allele group.
